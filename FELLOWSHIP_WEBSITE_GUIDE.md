## üôè **Final Thoughts**

This website exists to **serve the biblical concept of fellowship** - creating digital spaces where believers can experience the same authentic community that characterized the early church.

We are **NOT a church** - we are a **tool for fellowship**.

We are **NOT an institution** - we are a **platform for relationships**.

We are **NOT a replacement** - we are an **enhancement** to local community.

Our goal is simple: **Help believers connect, grow, and serve together in authentic fellowship, just as the early church did.**

**"And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved." - Acts 2:42, 47**
